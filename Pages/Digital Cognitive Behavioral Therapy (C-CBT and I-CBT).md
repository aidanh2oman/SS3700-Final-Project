> [!quote] Psychiatry in the Digital Age
> “Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered via computer (C-CBT, typically through CD-ROM) and CBT provided via the internet on a computer or mobile device (I-CBT) represent an avenue that shows the potential of digitalization in psychiatry. For instance, they can be used to treat depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, generalized anxiety disorders, panic disorders, social anxiety disorders, phobias, obsessive–compulsive disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders, and adjustment disorders”

> [!quote] Psychiatry in the Digital Age
> “C-CBT and I-CBT include different kinds of interventions. Patients can receive psychoeducation, analyze risk situations and triggers, capture and rate their thoughts and emotions, record their activities, and learn specific skills, such as coping, problem-solving, social skills, and cognitive restructuring. They can keep a sleep diary; perform exercises, such as exposure, relaxation, or mindfulness meditation; receive automated text messages or emails; and participate in online discussion forums”

> [!quote] Psychiatry in the Digital Age
> “Electronic interventions are not new to psychology; there is robust literature showing that Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a therapeutic approach that aims to change problematic thoughts and behaviors, can be effective for treating conditions such as depression, anxiety and eating disorders. But many of these online therapeutic programs are designed to be completed in lengthy sessions in front of a conventional computer screen.”
