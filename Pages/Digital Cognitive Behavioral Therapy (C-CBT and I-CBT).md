> “Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered via computer (C-CBT, typically through CD-ROM) and CBT provided via the internet on a computer or mobile device (I-CBT) represent an avenue that shows the potential of digitalization in psychiatry. For instance, they can be used to treat depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, generalized anxiety disorders, panic disorders, social anxiety disorders, phobias, obsessive–compulsive disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders, and adjustment disorders”

[[Carl Roth]] seems to support I-CBT strongly but I want to look into his points a little further about its validity.

> [!quote] Psychiatry in the Digital Age
> “C-CBT and I-CBT include different kinds of interventions. Patients can receive psychoeducation, analyze risk situations and triggers, capture and rate their thoughts and emotions, record their activities, and learn specific skills, such as coping, problem-solving, social skills, and cognitive restructuring. They can keep a sleep diary; perform exercises, such as exposure, relaxation, or mindfulness meditation; receive automated text messages or emails; and participate in online discussion forums”

This leaves me wondering what the new tools provide over something like a journal.

Regardless, there does seem to be evidence for the effectiveness of C-CBT and I-CBT

One big advantage of I-CBT is that it is "faster" than face-to-face CBT. I don't know how exactly they are measuring this so I will want to look into it further, but apparently traditional CBT takes 7.8 times more therapist time than I-CBT. This might just be because the therapist can jump from patient to patient quicker? Look into their citations further.

“Electronic interventions are not new to psychology; there is robust literature showing that Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), a therapeutic approach that aims to change problematic thoughts and behaviours, can be effective for treating conditions such as depression, anxiety and eating disorders. But many of these online therapeutic programmes are designed to be completed in lengthy sessions in front of a conventional computer screen.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9FUDVGA5?page=2&annotation=K43EXP6J)) Internet-based CBT is beneficial

“in a 2014 study of 45 veterans, more than 80% reported that the app helped them to track and manage their symptoms and provided practical solutions to their problems” ([Anthes, 2016, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/KIQK29K6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9FUDVGA5?page=2&annotation=HHHJZF4E)) look into this study and see if they actually got better or the connectivity just made them feel as if they were improving their mental health

“Fitzpatrick et al. demonstrated that the use of a chatbot may represent an opportunity to enhance adherence in I-CBT and app-delivered interventions by mirroring the therapeutic process and experience through a fully automated conversational agent [104]” ([Roth et al., 2021, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/RCK2B8V9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TLQAQA3Z?page=7&annotation=LZDABSYB)) Read this study
