Invented by Julian Leff in 2008, 'AVATAR Therapy' is a computer based treatment for mental illnesses and disorders such as psychosis, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar, severe depression. The idea is for patients who experience auditory hallucinations to have a conversation with a digital representation of their presumed persecutor, and gain power over it. The representative persecutor, or avatar, is voiced by the therapist, and responds with less hostility over time to let the patient gain that control over the voices and stand up to them. During this time the patient can prematurely end, or pause the session if they become too anxious or overwhelmed.

'AVATAR Therapy' is normally run in 6 weekly sessions, roughly thirty minutes each. The patient gets a recording of each session as well. More recently virtual reality has been used to enhance this further. 

"In a randomized controlled trial of AVATAR therapy, Craig et al. found a large effect size in reducing the severity of persistent auditory verbal hallucinations”.
