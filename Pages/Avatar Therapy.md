“The therapy is based on a three-way conversation between therapist, patient, and a digital simulation or avatar (including visual representation and voice) of the hallucinated voices. The software changes the therapist’s voice into a close match of the hallucinated voice. In a randomized controlled trial of AVATAR therapy, Craig et al. found a large effect size in reducing the severity of persistent auditory verbal hallucinations” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TLQAQA3Z?page=7&annotation=VDYRVC7N))
