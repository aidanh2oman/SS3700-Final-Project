“ML, based on the analysis of big data, opens the door to precision psychiatry. Ultimately, precision psychiatry may lead to the categorization of psychiatric patients into new data-driven subgroups. This novel categorization could improve patient care at various levels: homogenous disease classification, early diagnosis, prediction of disease trajectory, and tailored, more effective, safer, and predictable treatment, potentially at the individual level.”  ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TLQAQA3Z?page=15&annotation=RAS5QX5A))
