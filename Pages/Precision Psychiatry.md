Precision psychiatry presents a new path forward for connecting each patient with the exact treatments he or she needs, sooner, by using advances in science and technology.

It uses science and the understanding of neurobiological mechanisms to tailor a treatment plan to a client. 

As we understand how the brain and different disorders work, this type of therapy will become more efficient.

We can envision a future in which clinical decision-making is complemented by tools and measures that help to diagnose individual clinical biotype profiles and tailor treatments to these profiles.
