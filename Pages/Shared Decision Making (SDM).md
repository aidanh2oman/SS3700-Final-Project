“Health literacy can also facilitate shared decision-making in psychiatry (SDM). SDM can be defined as the process in which the physician provides the patient with clear and complete medical information to help them decide among multiple acceptable treatment options in accordance with his or her preferences [268,269]. In other words, the physician is the expert in the evidence, while the patient is the expert in what matters most to him or her [268].” ([Roth et al., 2021, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/RCK2B8V9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TLQAQA3Z?page=18&annotation=9GUUGNCB)) Shared Decision Making in healthcare (SDM)
