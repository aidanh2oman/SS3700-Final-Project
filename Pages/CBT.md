#TODO Write overview for CBT

CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) is a common form of therapy used today to treat many mental illnesses the most common of which are anxiety and depression. It has been extensively researched and shown to be an effective form of treatment. In mild and moderate depression and anxiety in most cases CBT alone can improve symptoms dramatically without medication. This therapy centers around exploring thoughts to learn how to reframe thoughts and change behaviors. During therapy patients can participate in exposure therapy cognitive an behavioral exercises and are often expected to do homework and participate actively in therapy.

“The protocol proposed by CBT to help patients deal with the effects produced by risk factors is the following: (1) address negative emotions, to help patients regulate their mood; (2) correct dysfunctional cognitions (negative thoughts and memories) by identifying expressed bias and evaluating their validity and usability, to elaborate better adaptive interpretations of the original cognitions; (3) challenge intermediate beliefs (attitudes, rules, and assumptions) held by the patient, to favour cognitive flexibility in the patient; and (4) debilitate the strength and rigidity with which the patient holds a negative core belief(s), to uproot the disorder [15,105,108].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=3&annotation=INUBS85V))
