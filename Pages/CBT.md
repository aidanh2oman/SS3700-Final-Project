“The protocol proposed by CBT to help patients deal with the effects produced by risk factors is the following: (1) address negative emotions, to help patients regulate their mood; (2) correct dysfunctional cognitions (negative thoughts and memories) by identifying expressed bias and evaluating their validity and usability, to elaborate better adaptive interpretations of the original cognitions; (3) challenge intermediate beliefs (attitudes, rules, and assumptions) held by the patient, to favour cognitive flexibility in the patient; and (4) debilitate the strength and rigidity with which the patient holds a negative core belief(s), to uproot the disorder [15,105,108].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=3&annotation=INUBS85V))

“disorder and help patients develop better adaptive strategies (i.e., protective factors) include: systematic gradual exposure, cognitive and behavioural exercises (e.g., homework), emotional heuristics, cognitive restructuring, collaborative empiricism, exploratory (i.e., Socratic) questioning, and constant feedback [15,59,105,108].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=3&annotation=UBBD2GPS))

“Defining terms is a technique used whenever the patient feels affected by the meaning she gives to a situation, rather than by the situation itself. The steps of this technique are: (1) elicit negative thought and ask for pa tient’s interpretation of it (key cognitions), (2) analyse validity and utility of key cognitions and compare to possible different interpretations, (3) summarize aspects of patient’s interpretations, and (4) derive a better-adaptive definition.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=7&annotation=5Y3PUFGG))

“The errors in logic technique is used whenever a patient arrives to illogical conclusions (e.g., extrapolation, over-generalization, etc.) [105]. The steps of this technique are: (1) select a thought that has an error in logic and divide it into sections (argument and conclusions), (2) objectively analyse conclusions by considering best- and worst-case scenarios, (3) draw a more realistic conclusion and elaborate better adaptive formulation of thought, and (4) meditate on logic of new thought.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=7&annotation=I7EHWTCV))

“Lastly, the technique to deal with dichotomous thinking is used as patients often engage in all-or-nothing thinking, over-emphasizing the negative aspects of an event, which leads them to feel trapped or helpless (e.g., if I am not perfect,I am the worthless) [105]. The steps of this technique are: (1) identify dichotomous thought and divide it into the two extreme conditions, (2) evaluate evidence that contradicts the thought’s rigidity, (3) suggest alternatives to thought and collabora tively derive new interpretations of event, and (4) evaluate validity of new interpretations and elaborate new better-balanced thoughts.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=7&annotation=QQURWTS6))

“To exemplify our use of cognitive-behavioural techniques to address memories, we present the role-playing technique and the defence attorney technique [105]. Role-playing is used whenever the patient feels trapped by a memory of someone hurting him/her in the past. The steps of this technique are: (1) elicit conflicting memory and ask patient to situate herself in that situation, (2) imagine a stronger version of the patient and using her words replay scene, (3) ask patient to defend herself and respond to attacks, and (4) collaboratively reconstruct memory using new words and actions. To implement this technique, we make use of game scenarios and characters, in particular the enemies.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=7&annotation=M5ATP9IW))

“Experts observe that a patient is more willing to defend the positive qualities of others rather than of him- or herself. For that reason, the patient is asked to defend a different person based on the same conditions [105]. The steps of this technique are: (1) ask patient to consider the case of other person; (2) use patient’s negative memories to judge the other person and ask patient to defend him/her; (3) listen to pa tient’s defence of other person, consider validity of defence, and summarize elements of defence; and (4) ask patientto reflect on why she can easily defend others yet criticize herself.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=7&annotation=DG7Q6IP5))
