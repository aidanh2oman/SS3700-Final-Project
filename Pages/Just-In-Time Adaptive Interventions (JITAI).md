> [!quote] [[Carl Roth - Psychiatry in the Digital Age]]
> “Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI) go one step further by integrating real-time data. The latter include self-reports (so-called “active data”, e.g., regarding mood regulation, sleep, hallucinations, medication adherence, substance use, and social functioning) and smartphone sensor data (so-called “passive data”, e.g., GPS, actigraphy, fitness tracker, patterns of typing and scrolling, or voice and speech analysis) to infer the patient’s context and “digital phenotype” (cognition, emotions, and behavior). The app then responds with customized interventions, such as notifications, encouraging physical activity, alerts asking the patient to walk away from his or her usual liquor store, or messages recommending that the patient take their medication”
