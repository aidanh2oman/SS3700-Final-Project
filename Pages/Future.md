mention [[Proposed Digital Technologies]]

#TODO Recommendations and concerns, our own ideas and reflections, different from unbiased info on history and present.

[[Multiple Composite Scenarios (MCS)]] removes the need for a therapist at all, or at least that is the goal of the developers of the framework

A big concern moving forward with new technologies is the risk of [[Deductive Disclosure]]

important to keep in mind that [[mHealth Therapy]] need to be blended with in-person treatment

[[Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAI)]] sounds interesting but leads to ethical questions relating to equality of users as well as how much understanding the user should have about how they interact with the app

adoption of [[Digital Medicine System (DMS)]] seems like it might be huge for the progression of healthcare
^^^
removes the need for the physician to trust the patient

must have [[Therapeutic Alliance]] regardless of the form of therapy
