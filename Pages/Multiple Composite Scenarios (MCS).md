**A thorough analysis of this might be out of scope**

Multiple Composite Scenarios (MCS) is a framework for [[Health Games]] that has shown efficacy in the prevention of anorexia. 

“In summary, the narrative of the game presents cautionary tales of how cognitive processes may be affected by risk factors, the consequences produced by cognitive biases, and ways to address them.”

“One similarity that our project has with technology-based activities is that MCS also contemplates the execution of activities within the health game. However, it differs in that MCS follows the entire protocol of CBT, and in that it does not require the active participation of a therapist during the intervention.”

“In general, CBT-inspired technology works as follows: (1) a task is presented to the user, and (2) a CBT-inspired feature is made available to the user so that he or she can solve the task. Our project differs from CBT-inspired technology in that our goal is to prevent a mental disorder, and that we do so through a methodology (MCS) that follows the entirety of CBT.”
