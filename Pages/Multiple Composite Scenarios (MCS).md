**A thorough analysis of this might be out of scope**

Multiple Composite Scenarios (MCS) is a framework for [[Health Games]] that has shown efficacy in the prevention of anorexia. 

“In summary, the narrative of the game presents cautionary tales of how cognitive processes may be affected by risk factors, the consequences produced by cognitive biases, and ways to address them.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=7&annotation=JUJKPAB2))

“The steps of MCS are: (1) introduce players to a risk factor they may encounter on their daily lives, (2) depict the consequences that occur to the virtual patient due to exposureto the risk factor,(3) inform players of cognitive-behavioural facts and psychoeducational material through trustworthy non-playing characters, (4) distract the player with game features to positively affect her mood, (5) evaluate/practice what was learned using cognitive-behavioural technique inspired puzzles and/or tasks, (6) defend virtual patient from the attacks of the enemies, (7) reflect about what was recently learned, (8) apply knowledge in virtual world, and (9) involve the player in the therapy of the virtual patient.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=10&annotation=5QINVR9Q))

“The first step of MCS is introduce. This step was inspired by the defining terms technique, and the first aspect of CBT sessions: quick update on patient’s life.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=10&annotation=ZYI6W573))

“The second step of MCSis depict. This step was inspiredby the second aspect of CBT sessions:collaboratively set the agenda” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=10&annotation=YP2QSHD5))

“The third step is inform. This step was inspired by the third aspect of CBT sessions: presentation of psychoeducational material.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=10&annotation=Z4JFGYDX))

“Step four is distract. This step was inspiredby the Veltentechnique.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=10&annotation=7FSMPHZ2))

“The fifth step is evaluate/practice. The fourth aspect of CBT sessions, the revision of homework, inspired this step” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=10&annotation=S8K9MWBZ))

“The sixth step is defend. This step was inspired by the defence attorney technique [105] and the fifth aspect of CBT sessions: address a current problem.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=10&annotation=UUVR4XDZ))

“Step seven of MCS is reflect. This step was inspired by the ABC technique and the sixthaspect of CBT sessions:summarize the content of session.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=10&annotation=4GH76P44))

“The eighth step is apply. This step was inspired by the conditional rules technique and the seventh aspect of CBT sessions: assign new homework based on current issues.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=10&annotation=47Q9NN8T))

“Step nine of MCS is involve. This step was inspired by the eighth aspect of CBT sessions, elicit constant feedback, as well as by experts’ recommendation.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=10&annotation=AI2Y4Q2V))

“One similaritythat our project has with technology-based activities is that MCS also contemplates the execution of activities within the health game. However, it differs in that MCS follows the entire protocol of CBT, and in that it does not require the active participation of a therapist during the intervention.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=20&annotation=82CXL785))

“In general, CBT-inspired technology works as follows: (1) a task is pre sented to the user, and (2) a CBT-inspired feature is made available to the user so that he or she can solve the task. Our project differs from CBT-inspired technology in that our goal is to preventa mental disorder, and that we do so through a methodology (MCS) that follows the entirety of CBT.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=20&annotation=BDN96HUV))

“These results suggest that the prevention of a mental disorder like AN with a MCS-based game is feasible.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V7EQ44H3?page=21&annotation=7CPMDWGE))
