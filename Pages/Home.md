## Introduction
The goal of this project was to develop an understanding of patient-physician relations in psychotherapy in a digital society. 

Patient-physician relations in psychotherapy can fall on a spectrum from no relationship to a healthy [[Therapeutic Alliance]]

Psychotherapy in a digital society consists of traditional psychotherapy that has been developing for quite a long time and new digital technologies. The option to use or reject these technologies arguably complicates the patient-physician relationship but there is room for new possibilities if these technologies are accepted.

## Project Description
[[History (2000-2020)]] provides an overview of the research we conducted that explains our topic before the impact of COVID-19

[[Present (2020-2023)]] explains the new technologies, a lot of which were developed in response to COVID-19

[[Future]] houses our recommendations and concerns, these are our own ideas and reflections that the research has led us to.
