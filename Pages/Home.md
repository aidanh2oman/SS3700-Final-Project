## Introduction
The goal of this project was to develop an understanding of patient-physician relations in psychotherapy in a digital society. 

patient-physician relations in psychotherapy can fall on a spectrum from no relationship to a healthy [[Therapeutic Alliance]]

psychotherapy in a digital society consists of traditional psychotherapy that has been developing for quite a long time and new digital technologies. The option to use or reject these technologies arguably complicates the patient-physician relationship but there is room for new possibilities if these technologies are accepted.

## Project Description and Abstract
#TODO abstract

[[History (2000-2020)]] provides an overview of the research we conducted that explains our topic before the impact of COVID-19

[[Present (2020-2023)]] explains the new technologies, a lot of which were developed in response to COVID-19

[[Future]] houses our recommendations and concerns, these are our own ideas and reflections that the research has led us to.

## Where to go now
If you are looking for an overview of the research we did, you should start in [[History (2000-2020)]] and [[Present (2020-2023)]]

If you want to see where the research has led us, start at [[Future]], there you can find our reflections, concerns, and recommendations

## Friday Presentation
start with [[History (2000-2020)]] and move into [[Telepsychiatry]]. Show [[Present (2020-2023)]] ->[[Current Digital Technologies]]->[[Proposed Digital Technologies]]-> [[Future]] to explain key findings.
