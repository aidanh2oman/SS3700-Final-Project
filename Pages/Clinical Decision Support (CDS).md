> “Clinical decision support (CDS) provides clinicians with knowledge (e.g., treatment guidelines) and patient-specific information (e.g., clinical and laboratory data), specifically selected and presented in a timely fashion, to enhance the quality of medical care. Running in the background of EHR, CDS can provide automated alerts (e.g., in case of abnormal vital signs), automated reminders (e.g., reminding the physician of routine laboratory testing in patients taking psychotropic medications), and information related to drug prescription (e.g., dosage, contraindications, allergies, and interactions).”
