A therapeutic alliance is a cooperative working relationship between client and therapist, considered by many to be an essential aspect of successful therapy.

It is a measure of the therapist's and client's mutual engagement in the work of therapy

The therapeutic alliance comprises bonds, goals, and tasks

Bonds are constituted by the core conditions of therapy, the client’s attitude toward the therapist, and the therapist’s style of relating to the client

goals are the mutually negotiated, understood, agreed upon, and regularly reviewed aims of the therapy

tasks are the activities carried out by both client and therapist



“In a meta-analysis, the relationship between therapeutic alliance and psychotherapy outcomes was shown to be comparable between face-to-face and eHealthbased psychotherapy, including phone, internet, videoconferencing, and email [203].” ([Roth et al., 2021, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/RCK2B8V9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TLQAQA3Z?page=19&annotation=S7JZDJMH)) Therapeutic Alliance is important in all forms of therapy
