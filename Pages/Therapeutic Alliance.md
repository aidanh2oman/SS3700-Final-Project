A therapeutic alliance is a cooperative working relationship between patient and therapist, considered by many to be an essential aspect of successful therapy.

It is a measure of the therapist's and client's mutual engagement in the work of therapy

The therapeutic alliance comprises bonds, goals, and tasks
- Bonds are constituted by the core conditions of therapy, the client’s attitude toward the therapist, and the therapist’s style of relating to the client
- Goals are the mutually negotiated, understood, agreed upon, and regularly reviewed aims of the therapy
- Tasks are the activities carried out by both client and therapist

> “In a meta-analysis, the relationship between therapeutic alliance and psychotherapy outcomes was shown to be comparable between face-to-face and [[mHealth Therapy|eHealthbased psychotherapy]], including phone, internet, videoconferencing, and email.”
