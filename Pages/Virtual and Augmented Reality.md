Virtual reality (VR) has proven to be a powerful tool to help people overcome PTSD and many other mental health issues including phobias, anxiety, and depression.

Success can be judged on the digital experience’s ability to simulate the real-world environment that it attempts to recreate.

VR's goal is to “create sensory illusions that produce a more or less believable simulation of reality” 

VR allows people to experience their fears or triggering situations in a realistic digital environment.
