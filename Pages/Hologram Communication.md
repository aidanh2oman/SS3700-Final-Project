“A new, innovative technology is about to change telepsychiatry. In May 2021, Google presented a holographic video communication system that allows users to see a 3D hologram of the person they are talking to. Google describes the new technology in the following way: “Imagine looking through a sort of magic window, and through that window, you see another person, life-size, and in three dimensions. You can talk naturally, gesture, and make eye contact”. Interestingly, Google indicated that they tested the new technology with healthcare companies. Its impact on telepsychiatry could be tremendous.”
