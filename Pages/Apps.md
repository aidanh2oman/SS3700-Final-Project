Apps are used to improve mental health in many areas from exercise, to journaling, breathing exercises, and AI led therapy. Some apps have been researched more than others and some have shown to be helpful and others have not. One app which used AI CBT showed comparable results to traditional CBT for effective treatment of anxiety and depression in college students. Other apps are used to help people remember to take their medication. More research and development of apps is needed in this area to determine the extent to which mental health can be managed with technology.
