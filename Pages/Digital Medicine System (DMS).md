> “The digital medicine system (DMS) represents a novel and quite radical step towards further improvement of medication adherence. The DMS includes the following elements [138–143]: First, a sensor smaller than a sesame seed, contained in the pill and activated upon interaction with stomach fluid, is ingested. After activation, the sensor sends a signal with a specific code. The sensor is made of ingredients found in the food supply and is eliminated through feces. Second, an adhesive patch placed on the patient’s skin detects the signal transmitted by the sensor. The patch also monitors various health information, such as heart rate and number of steps; that is, physical activity. Third, a mobile device application collects data from the patch and sends them to the cloud. Patients can access these data through the mobile application, while physicians can view them on an internet portal. The application also reminds patients to take their medication as prescribed.”
